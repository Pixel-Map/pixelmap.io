  "description": "A little over a decade ago, a website called MillionDollarHomePage.com was created by Alex Tew.  The page consisted (and still consists) of a 1000x1000 pixel grid, with a total of 1,000,000 pixels being sold for $1 each.  Because the pixels themselves were too small to be seen individually, they were sold in 10x10 pixel tiles for $100 each.  The purchasers of each tile then provided a 10x10 pixel image to be used, as well as optionally a URL for the tile to link to.  Once an image had been configured for a given tile however, it could never be changed (nor could the ownership of the tile).",
